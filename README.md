# cloud-native-java
Project for me to work through the code examples described in the Book Cloud Native Java

Generally I will follow the examples made by Josh Long and Kenny Bastani's Book Cloud Native Java.  There examples are found here https://github.com/cloud-native-java/testing

My examples will be attempt at learning by doing but taking some shortcuts where I dont want to follow the exact structure of their examples.

Warning: poetic license beyond.
